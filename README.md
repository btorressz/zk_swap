# ZK-Swap AMM ($ZKSWAP) ‚Äì Privacy-Preserving Automated Market Maker

## üöÄ Overview

**ZK-Swap AMM** is a practice project designed to improve **Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proof** skills within the **Solana blockchain** ecosystem, specifically focusing on **privacy-preserving trading** in an **automated market maker (AMM)** environment.

This project explores **ZK-SNARKs, commit-reveal schemes, MEV protection, and stealth trading** techniques to create a **confidential and secure decentralized trading system**.

## üìå Core Features

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Privacy-Preserving Swaps
- Uses **ZK-SNARKs** to validate transactions **without revealing trade details**.
- Traders can **swap tokens anonymously**, preventing order tracking.
- **Stealth addresses** dynamically generate unique addresses for each trade.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Zero-Knowledge Staking
- Traders must **stake $ZKSWAP tokens** to access **private liquidity pools**.
- **Proof-of-stake verification** is done **without exposing balances**.
- **Staking influences trading priority** and provides **fee discounts**.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ MEV & Front-Running Protection
- Uses **commit-reveal mechanisms** to ensure **fair trade execution**.
- **Randomized execution delays** make it impossible to anticipate trades.
- **Frequent Batch Auctions (FBA)** minimize **front-running risks**.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Optimizations
- **Batch ZK Proof Verification:** Groups multiple swaps into a single proof.
- **State Compression:** Reduces **on-chain storage costs** for proofs.
- **Recursive Proof Aggregation:** Aggregates multiple swaps into **one verification step**.

## üîÑ How It Works

| **Step**  | **Description** |
|-----------|----------------|
| 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Commit** | A trader submits a commitment hash representing their swap details. |
| 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Reveal** | The trader submits a **ZK-proof** and **encrypted swap data** to validate the trade. |
| 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Verification** | The program checks the **ZK-SNARK proof** and executes the swap. |
| 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Execution** | The trade is executed **without revealing the original order details**. |

## üîê Security Features

| **Feature** | **Description** |
|------------|----------------|
| **Anti-Sybil Resistance** | Traders must **stake $ZKSWAP tokens** to execute private swaps. |
| **ZK-Proof Verification** | Transactions are validated with **ZK-SNARKs** instead of plaintext verification. |
| **Stealth Addresses** | Uses **ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman)** to generate **temporary trade addresses**. |
| **Time-Lock Protection** | **Randomized delays** obfuscate trade execution timing to **prevent MEV**. |
